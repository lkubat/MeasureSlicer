To the extent that the Measure Slicer extends Microsoft's Power BI custom visual API, it does not 
store any user data locally or transfer any data to the developers or any third party.  The developers 
of the Measure Slicer cannot guarantee that data is not collected or transferred by the custom visual 
API itself.  We do affirm that no code under our control is storing or transfering any personal data,
but we do not imply or affirm any prevention of or protection against data stored or transferred by 
Microsoft through its Power BI custom visual API.
