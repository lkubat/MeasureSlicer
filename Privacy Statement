To the extent that the Measure Slicer extends Microsoft's Power BI custom visual API, it does not 
store any user data locally or transfer any data to the developers or any third party.  The developers 
of the Measure Slicer cannot guarantee that data is not collected or transferred by the custom visual 
API itself, but we do affirm that we are not storing or transferring any additional data ourselves.
