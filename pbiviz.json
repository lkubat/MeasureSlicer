    "description": "The measure slicer was built to allow a report to be filtered down to data related to the user running the report without locking the entire cube down via row level security.  It provides this functionality in a general way so it can be used for other purposes.  It takes a single category and a measure, computes the measure for each category, and displays only the distinct non-blank measure values computed.  Then when a measure value is selected, it slices the report on all the category values whose measure value computed to the one selected.  If you then create a measure on your worker dimension that evaluates to 'Is Me' if the worker matches the current user, you can use this to filter a report on only the workers who 'Is Me'.  Obviously this can be used for other purposes as well.",
